Eloquent Ruby by Russ Olsen
===========================

What I liked:
-------------


Olsen does some downright cool things with ruby that are very remarkable to see.

The "Staying Out of Trouble" and "In the Wild" sections went beyond simply stating what best practices are by explaining possible risks and use cases.

Much of the code can be easily paralleled to rails applications.

The chapters are well organized. This book can be read cover-to-cover or used as a reference.

The text is not preachy. Olsen drives his points with effective examples that speak for themselves.

The chapter about self-modifying classes was very cool.

What I didn't like:
-------------------

The document class example used throughout the text, although comprehensive, was a bit dry for my taste.

Summary:
--------

This book definitely comes recommended. This was my first major programming read after Chris Pine's _Learn to Program_. It provides great exposure to different uses of ruby beyond the fundamental applications. Olsen covers a large range of useful topics while going into enough depth on each of them. There is a wealth of information provided. It seems like this book is ideal to read through and then use as a reference thereafter.

One last note--I have started reading _Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer_ by Sandi Metz, and I wish that I had read that before _Eloquent Ruby_. The Metz book seems just a bit more approachable for a newer programmer, but that is not to say that _Eloquent Ruby_ was not.
